Here is the corrected and concise README.md. I updated the development section to reflect that only the concept was vetted by tutors, and moved the full history feature to the Roadmap.

Der Die Das Drill: Slot Edition 🎰
A streamlined, focus-driven trainer for mastering German noun genders.

"This project was developed out of necessity. I needed a tool that satisfied my own requirements for learning German nouns effectively—something visual, rhythmic, and distraction-free. It is free for you to use. Feel free to share this with friends in need!"

🌟 Functional Features
Slot Machine Mechanic: Words slide in vertically. The active word is crisp and large, while the upcoming word is blurred to maintain focus.

Visual Mnemonics:

<span style="color:#4b8bff">Der (Masculine)</span> = Blue

<span style="color:#ff6cae">Die (Feminine)</span> = Pink

<span style="color:#ffd84b">Das (Neuter)</span> = Yellow

Immediate Feedback: Correct answers "snap" the article to the noun and color-code it. Wrong answers trigger a tactile "shake" animation.

Previous Word Retention: The last solved word remains visible at the bottom, fading out slowly so you can review your last action.

Level Selection: Filter vocabulary by A1, A2, B1, or B2 (CEFR standards).

Keyboard Support: A (Der), S (Die), D (Das).

🔮 Roadmap
Session History: A scrollable log of all words solved during the current session.

🛠️ How It Was Built
AI-Assisted Development: Built with advanced AI assistance to ensure clean, modular code.

Iterative Design: Evolved through multiple versions to perfect the "tactile" feel and physics of the animations.

Tutor-Vetted Concept: The core pedagogical approach and gamification strategy were discussed with professional German tutors to ensure the learning method is effective.
